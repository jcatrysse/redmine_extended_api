    # Every SPA permission id (`issues.view`, `reports.agile.cfd`, ...) is stored on a Redmine
    # role as its own permission symbol — `sprintly__issues__view` — so the role keeps exactly
    # what the Roles screen saved, and `User#allowed_to?` answers for it like for any core
    # permission (project modules, archived projects and group memberships included).
    #
    # Next to those, a role carries the core permissions they imply (DERIVED), which is what
    # makes Redmine itself enforce the role: `issues.view` brings `view_issues`, and so on.
    # The derived set is recomputed on every save; it is never edited on its own.
