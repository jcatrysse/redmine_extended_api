# Redmine Extended API

**ATTENTION: ALPHA STAGE**

This plugin exposes Redmine's REST API under an alternate base path and unlocks write access for administrative resources that are read-only in vanilla Redmine. Every request keeps the native controllers, permission checks, and response formats, so it behaves exactly like Redmine would if those endpoints were public.

## Overview

- `/extended_api` is a drop-in proxy of the core REST API. Anything that works under the default paths continues to work unchanged when you prepend the new base path.
- Additional write operations are enabled for catalogue-like resources (roles, custom fields, issue statuses, trackers, and enumerations). The plugin reuses the built-in controllers, so validation rules and workflows stay identical to the web UI.
- Optional integrations (for example `redmine_depending_custom_fields`) automatically surface their own REST attributes whenever they expose compatible controllers.

## Core vs. extended coverage

| Resource category                                                                                    | Core Redmine behaviour                               | What the plugin adds                                                                                      | Notes                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Issues, projects, time tracking, files, wiki, news, memberships, queries, search, repositories, etc. | Already exposed through the official REST API.       | Proxied verbatim under `/extended_api`.                                                                   | Use this when you want an isolated gateway without touching existing integrations. |
| Administrative catalogs: roles, trackers, issue statuses, enumerations, custom fields                | Limited to HTML UI in core. No REST write endpoints. | Adds authenticated POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE plus enriched payloads while keeping Redmine's permission model. | These endpoints live exclusively under `/extended_api`.                            |
| Third-party plugins with API-aware controllers (e.g. `redmine_depending_custom_fields`)              | Varies per plugin.                                   | Their API actions are automatically available when routed through `/extended_api`.                        | The extended API exposes any additional attributes permitted by the plugin.        |

If you only need core behaviour, keep using the official REST endpoints. The plugin does not override or patch the original routes.
All new endpoints will have a recognisable JSON /XML payload:
``` json
{"extended_api":{"mode":"extended","fallback_to_native":false}}
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your Redmine plugins directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/redmine/plugins
   git clone https://github.com/jcatrysse/redmine_extended_api.git
   ```
2. Restart Redmine.

No database migrations are required at this stage.

## Testing

`RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rspec plugins/redmine_extended_api/spec`

## Usage

All REST API calls that ship with Redmine remain available at their original paths. The plugin adds a drop-in replacement under `/extended_api` where the behaviour, payloads, and permissions are identical because every request is proxied back to the core Rails stack.

> **Note**
> Only controllers/actions that support API authentication in Redmine are exposed through the proxy. Requests targeting HTML-only controllers (e.g. `/my/page`) return `404` from `/extended_api` because those routes are intentionally outside the scope.

### Authentication & formats

- **Authentication**: identical to core Redmine. Use an API key via the `X-Redmine-API-Key` header or HTTP Basic with a user account that has REST access.
- **Formats**: JSON (`.json`) and XML (`.xml`) endpoints only. Requests without one of these extensions return `404` to avoid exposing the HTML UI through `/extended_api`.

### Base paths

| Description       | Core path           | Extended path                    |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| API root          | `/`                 | `/extended_api`                  |
| Issues collection | `/issues`           | `/extended_api/issues`           |
| Nested endpoints  | `/projects/:id/...` | `/extended_api/projects/:id/...` |

The rule is: prepend `/extended_api` to any Redmine REST API path (including nested ones) and keep the rest unchanged.

### Issue-specific utilities

The extended API keeps the native responses from Redmine's issue endpoints while adding a couple of quality-of-life options:

- Suppress notifications when creating or updating issues by passing `notify=false` (or `send_notification=0`). The request is still fully validated, only the mail delivery is skipped.
- Preserve history when migrating data by explicitly setting `author_id`, `created_on`, `updated_on`, or `closed_on` on issues. These overrides are only applied for admin users routed through `/extended_api`, and automatic timestamp updates are disabled for the request to keep the supplied values intact.
- Preserve journal provenance when importing by supplying `journal[created_on]`,`journal[user_id]`, `journal[updated_on]`, or `journal[updated_by_id]` in extended issue requests. Admin-only overrides are applied to the generated journal entry while temporarily disabling journal timestamp updates to respect the provided values.
- Successful issue updates that create a journal entry return the journal payload when routed through `/extended_api`, making it easy to confirm the resulting notes and metadata.

### Attachment-specific utilities

- Preserve uploader history on imported files by supplying `author_id` and/or `created_on` in `/extended_api/attachments` requests. Overrides are limited to admin users and keep the provided timestamp intact by disabling automatic timestamp updates for the request.

#### Real-world examples for issues and journals

- Import a closed issue while preserving the original author and timestamps and suppressing outbound mail:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
    -d '{"issue":{"project_id":1,"tracker_id":2,"status_id":5,"subject":"Legacy outage record","description":"Backfilled from the legacy tracker","author_id":7,"created_on":"2023-11-02T08:15:00Z","updated_on":"2023-11-04T17:40:00Z","closed_on":"2023-11-04T17:40:00Z"},"notify":false}' \
    https://redmine.example.com/extended_api/issues.json
  ```

- Add an imported journal entry to an existing issue, keep the original editor and timestamp, and avoid triggering notifications:

  ```bash
  curl -X PATCH \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
    -d '{"issue":{"notes":"Imported worklog from JIRA","journal":{"user_id":7,"updated_by_id":7,"created_on":"2023-12-01T11:00:00Z","updated_on":"2023-12-01T12:00:00Z"}},"notify":false}' \
    https://redmine.example.com/extended_api/issues/123.json
  ```

  ```json
  {
    "extended_api": {
      "mode": "extended",
      "fallback_to_native": false
    },
    "journal": {
      "id": 456,
      "issue_id": 123,
      "notes": "Imported worklog from JIRA",

        "id": 7,
        "name": "Jane Doe"
      },
      "details": []
    }
  }
  ```

- Upload an attachment while preserving the original uploader and timestamp (admin users only):

  ```bash
  curl --globoff -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
    -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
    --data-binary "@legacy-log.txt" \
    "https://redmine.example.com/extended_api/uploads.json?filename=legacy-log.txt&attachment[author_id]=7&attachment[created_on]=2023-11-02T08:15:00.509723Z"
  ```

  ```bash
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
    -d '{
    "issue": {
    "project_id": 1,
    "tracker_id": 3,
    "status_id": 5,
    "subject": "Legacy outage record with attachment - admin",

    }
    ]
    },
    "notify": false
    }' \
  https://redmine.example.com/extended_api/issues.json
  ```     

  ```bash  
  curl -X PATCH \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
    -d '{
    "issue": {

### Availability legend

The reference tables below use the following terms:

- **Core (proxy)** – the operation already exists in Redmine and is simply proxied under `/extended_api`.
- **Core & Extended** – the operation already exists in Redmine and has been enhanced under `/extended_api`.
- **Extended only (new)** – the operation is exposed exclusively by this plugin. Core Redmine does not ship a REST equivalent.

## Extended endpoint reference

All paths require either `.json` or `.xml` and the usual authentication headers. The `Core Redmine` column lists the public path when one exists.

### Depending on custom field options (optional)

When the [`redmine_depending_custom_fields`](https://github.com/jcatrysse/redmine_depending_custom_fields) plugin is installed, the extended API exposes additional attributes for managing value dependencies. These attributes are not available in core Redmine.

| Operation                                   | Method(s)      | Extended path                                | Availability        | Notes                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Manage dependency metadata on custom fields | POST/PUT/PATCH | `/extended_api/custom_fields(/:id).{format}` | Extended only (new) | Accepts `value_dependencies`, `default_value_dependencies`, `hide_when_disabled`, etc., mirroring the plugin's UI. |

## JSON write examples

The new administrative writing endpoints accept JSON or XML payloads. The snippets below provide end-to-end examples for the most common mutations, including payloads for [`redmine_depending_custom_fields`](https://github.com/jcatrysse/redmine_depending_custom_fields). Replace `https://redmine.example.com` and `<token>` with values from your environment.

### Issue statuses

```bash
# Create a new issue status
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
  -d '{"issue_status":{"name":"QA Review","is_closed":false,"position":7,"default_done_ratio":50}}' \
  https://redmine.example.com/extended_api/issue_statuses.json

# Update an existing issue status and close it
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
  -d '{"issue_status":{"name":"Deployed","is_closed":true,"default_done_ratio":100}}' \
  https://redmine.example.com/extended_api/issue_statuses/9.json
```

### Trackers

```bash
# Create a tracker that inherits core fields and applies to specific projects
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
  -d '{"tracker":{"name":"Deployment","default_status_id":1,"core_fields":["assigned_to_id","fixed_version_id"],"project_ids":[1,3]}}' \
  https://redmine.example.com/extended_api/trackers.json

# Update a tracker, add a project and extend the core fields
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
  -d '{"tracker":{"project_ids":[1,3,5],"core_fields":["assigned_to_id","fixed_version_id","category_id"]}}' \
  https://redmine.example.com/extended_api/trackers/5.json
```

### Enumerations

```bash
# Create a time entry activity enumeration
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
  -d '{"enumeration":{"type":"TimeEntryActivity","name":"Pair programming","active":true}}' \
  https://redmine.example.com/extended_api/enumerations.json

# Delete an enumeration and reassign existing records
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
  "https://redmine.example.com/extended_api/enumerations/12.json?reassign_to_id=8"
```

### Roles

```bash
# Create a role with custom permissions and managed roles
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
  -d '{"role":{"name":"Deployment manager","assignable":true,"permissions":["manage_versions","manage_members"],"managed_role_ids":[2,3]}}' \
  https://redmine.example.com/extended_api/roles.json

# Update a role to toggle a permission and default membership
curl -X PATCH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
  -d '{"role":{"permissions":["edit_issues","manage_public_queries"],"settings":{"users_visibility":"members_of_visible_projects"}}}' \
  https://redmine.example.com/extended_api/roles/6.json
```

### Custom fields

List-based custom fields (`field_format: "list"`) still use the legacy `possible_values` array of strings. Enumeration-based custom fields (`field_format: "enumeration"`) are backed by API-managed `enumerations` objects instead. Each entry can set `name`, `active`, and `position`; include the `id` when updating to preserve identities, and pass the enumeration id as the `default_value` when you want the field to preselect one of the options.

```bash
# Create a project custom field with explicit possible values
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: <token>" \
  -d '{"type":"ProjectCustomField","custom_field":{"name":"Deployment region","field_format":"list","possible_values":["EU","US","APAC"],"is_required":true}}' \
  https://redmine.example.com/extended_api/custom_fields.json

# Create an enumeration custom field backed by API-managed options
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
